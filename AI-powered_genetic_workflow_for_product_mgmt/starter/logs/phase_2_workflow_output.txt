Defining workflow steps from the workflow prompt

--- Executing step: The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed by the development team. These tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). ---
[Router] Product Manager similarity = 0.492
[Router] Program Manager similarity = 0.510
[Router] Development Engineer similarity = 0.564
[Router] Best agent: Development Engineer (score=0.564)

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed by the development team. These tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
Worker Agent Response:
To define the development tasks for a product, you should start by reviewing each user story and breaking it down into smaller, actionable tasks. These tasks should be specific and clearly defined to ensure that the development team understands what needs to be done. Tasks may include activities such as coding the necessary features, writing unit tests to ensure functionality, designing the user interface, documenting the changes made, and deploying the updates to the production environment. Each task should be measurable so progress can be tracked, achievable within a reasonable timeframe, relevant to the user story being implemented, and time-bound to ensure timely completion. By breaking down user stories into development tasks, you can effectively plan and execute the work required to deliver a successful product.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer provided does not meet the criteria specified. The answer does not follow the exact structure of Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent should ensure that the response follows the exact structure provided, which includes the following sections:

1. Task ID
2. Task Title
3. Related User Story
4. Description
5. Acceptance Criteria
6. Estimated Effort
7. Dependencies

The worker agent should review the original answer and make sure that each section is clearly defined and follows the specified format. If any section is missing or not in the correct order, they should rearrange and provide the necessary information to meet the criteria.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement

Worker Agent Response:
1. Task ID: 001
2. Task Title: Code the necessary features
3. Related User Story: As a user, I want to be able to create a profile on the platform
4. Description: Develop the backend and frontend code required to allow users to create a profile on the platform. This includes setting up the database schema, creating API endpoints for user registration, and designing the user interface for the profile creation form.
5. Acceptance Criteria: 
   - Users should be able to input their information (such as name, email, password) into the profile creation form.
   - Upon submission, the user's profile details should be stored in the database.
   - Users should receive a confirmation message upon successful profile creation.
6. Estimated Effort: 8 hours
7. Dependencies: Completion of database setup and API endpoint design.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
