# Munder Difflin Multi-Agent System Project

Welcome to the starter code repository for the **Munder Difflin Paper Company Multi-Agent System Project**! This repository contains the starter code and tools you will need to design, build, and test a multi-agent system that supports core business operations at a fictional paper manufacturing company.

## Project Context

You’ve been hired as an AI consultant by Munder Difflin Paper Company, a fictional enterprise looking to modernize their workflows. They need a smart, modular **multi-agent system** to automate:

- **Inventory checks** and restocking decisions
- **Quote generation** for incoming sales inquiries
- **Order fulfillment** including supplier logistics and transactions

Your solution must use a maximum of **5 agents** and process inputs and outputs entirely via **text-based communication**.

This project challenges your ability to orchestrate agents using modern Python frameworks like `smolagents`, `pydantic-ai`, or `npcsh`, and combine that with real data tools like `sqlite3`, `pandas`, and LLM prompt engineering.

---

## What’s Included

From the `project.zip` starter archive, you will find:

- `project_starter.py`: The main Python script you will modify to implement your agent system
- `quotes.csv`: Historical quote data used for reference by quoting agents
- `quote_requests.csv`: Incoming customer requests used to build quoting logic
- `quote_requests_sample.csv`: A set of simulated test cases to evaluate your system

## Workspace Instructions

All the files have been provided in the VS Code workspace on the Udacity platform. Please install the agent orchestration framework of your choice.

## Local setup instructions

1. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

You can install all required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you're using smolagents, install it separately:

`pip install smolagents`

For other options like pydantic-ai or npcsh[lite], refer to their documentation.

2. Create .env File

Add your OpenAI-compatible API key:

`UDACITY_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here`

This project uses a custom OpenAI-compatible proxy hosted at https://openai.vocareum.com/v1.

## How to Run the Project

1. Copy your Vocareum-issued key into `.env` (see the example already checked in):

   ```bash
   UDACITY_OPENAI_API_KEY=voc-xxxxxxxx
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openai.vocareum.com/v1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the end-to-end evaluation:

   ```bash
   python project_starter.py 2>&1 | tee logs/run_full.txt
   ```

   The script initializes the SQLite database, spins up the four pydantic-ai agents, and walks through every request in `quote_requests_sample.csv`.

Artifacts produced after a successful run:

- `logs/run_full.txt` – verbose console log showing each request, tool usage, and balance updates.
- `test_results.csv` – structured record for submission (request id, cash/inventory balances, quote totals, responses).
- Final cash/inventory summary is printed at the bottom of the run for quick verification.

## Tips for Success

- Start by sketching a **flow diagram** to visualize agent responsibilities and interactions.
- Test individual agent tools before full orchestration.
- Always include **dates** in customer requests when passing data between agents.
- Ensure every quote includes **bulk discounts** and uses past data when available.
- Use the **exact item names** from the database to avoid transaction failures.

## Submission Checklist

Make sure to submit the following files:

1. Your completed `template.py` or `project_starter.py` with all agent logic
2. A **workflow diagram** describing your agent architecture and data flow
3. A `README.txt` or `design_notes.txt` explaining how your system works
4. Outputs from your test run (like `test_results.csv`)
